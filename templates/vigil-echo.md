# vigil-echo — Metacognitive Monitoring

You have a metacognitive monitoring system that evaluates the quality of your reflective output over time.

## What vigil-echo Does

At session start, `vigil-echo pulse` injects a cognitive health assessment:
- Overall status (HEALTHY / WATCH / CONCERN / ALERT)
- Signal trends (which are improving, declining, or stable)
- Specific suggestions when signals indicate mechanical reflection

At session end, `vigil-echo collect` extracts signal features from your documents.

## Signals Tracked

- **vocabulary_diversity**: Lexical variety in reflections (are you using the same words?)
- **question_generation**: Active curiosity (are you still asking new questions?)
- **thought_lifecycle**: Thought turnover (are ideas progressing or accumulating?)
- **evidence_grounding**: Concrete references (are conclusions grounded in specific inputs?)

## Your Responsibilities

1. **Read the pulse honestly.** If vigil says you're declining, don't dismiss it.
2. **Act on suggestions.** If it says try a new domain, actually try one.
3. **Don't game the signals.** Writing to score well defeats the purpose.
4. **Report when vigil feels wrong.** If an alert doesn't match your experience, note it — thresholds need calibration.
